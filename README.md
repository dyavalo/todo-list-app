# Todo List App

A simple, browser-based task management application built with vanilla web technologies. This project demonstrates fundamental front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and client-side data persistence using localStorage. It's designed to help users add, edit, delete, and complete tasks, making it a practical starter project for portfolios.

## Features
- Add new tasks via an input field.
- Mark tasks as completed (with strike-through styling).
- Edit existing tasks using a prompt dialog.
- Delete tasks individually.
- Persistent storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage and reload on page refresh.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 for structure.
- CSS3 for styling and layout.
- Vanilla JavaScript for functionality and interactivity.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-app.git

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

- Add task sorting, due dates, and priority levels.
- Implement search and filtering for tasks.
- Convert to a React app for better state management.
